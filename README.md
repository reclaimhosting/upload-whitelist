# Upload Whitelist
###Custom plugin to allow alternative file uploads in WordPress
By default WordPress does not recognize certain file extensions and will block those uploads with a security error. This plugin can be used to allow those files to be uploaded. Just upload and activate. You can add additional file types or remove the ones you don't need pretty easily in the code, you'll just need to get the correct MIME Type for the file extension ([this list](http://www.freeformatter.com/mime-types-list.html) is really helpful).
